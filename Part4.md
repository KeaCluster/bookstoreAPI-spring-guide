# Part 4 - API Development

This section will focus on the code-aspect of our API. Take note that due to the considerable size of the project, we won't be able to write every single line of code here. Most of the entities will be left out. But necessary annotations and concepts are *definitely* going to be shown here.

Take this as what we are really doing here: A **guide**. So practice, research, and put your knowledge and understanding to the test.

## Models

Models are the *OOP* representation of the relational entities inside the database. This includes: foreign keys, attributes and primary keys, alongside some extra things we could come across.

So how exactly do we translate all of this to a `java` class? Very simple:

### Book



## Controllers

## Repositories

## Services
