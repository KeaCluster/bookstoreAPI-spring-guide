# Springboot Bookstore API guide

## Intro

A beginner's guide to building a small REST-API using Spring Boot. This guide covers various aspects of software development including requirements gathering, system design, development, and deployment preparations. 

> There isn't that much info to go through. We won't look at any front-end aspects of development as this is not the purpose. However we will dive into some basic theory about `MVC` and `REST-API` services.

Keep in mind this is a beginner-friendly guide. If you want/are in search for an advanced and robust guide on to how to develop a functional, secure and production-ready REST-API, this is not the place. With that said and clear, I hope you find the following document of help. Good luck on your development journey and remember to [keep things simple](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)
