## Intro

A beginner's guide to building a small REST-API using Spring Boot.
This guide covers various aspects of software development including:
requirements gathering, system design, development, and deployment preparations.

> [!NOTE]
> There isn't that much info to go through.
> We won't look at any front-end aspects of development as this is not the purpose.
> However we will dive into some basic theory about `MVC` and `REST-API` services.

Keep in mind this is a beginner-friendly guide.
If you're in search for an advanced/robust guide on to how to develop a functional,
secure and production-ready REST-API, this is not the place.
With that said and clear, I hope you find the following document of help.
Good luck on your development journey and remember to
