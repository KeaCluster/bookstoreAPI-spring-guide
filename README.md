# spring-bookstoreAPI-guide

Small REST-API guide with Springboot for when in need of one. This guide will go through some aspects of requirements, designing the system and development, up to final adjustments and preparing it for deployment.

Take in mind this is a starter guide. If you want or are in search for a more advanced and robust guide on to how to develop a functional, secure and production-ready REST-API, this is not the place. With that in mind, I hope you find the following document of help.
